# Improved-Waste-Collection-Segregation-and-Handling-policy

## Introduction:
In most developing countries, waste handling is a menace and most if not all ends up in a landfills, which in turn poses a greater risk to sorrounding communities and is responsible for  production of methane gas.
With proper waste segregation and handling, lots of waste that could otherwise end up in a landfill, could be reused, recycled or composted thereby overstretching landfills in developing countries.
In many developing countries  urban areas waste collection services are inadequate or non-existent, Lack of proper infrastructure, equipment, and funding for waste collection services leads to the accumulation of waste in public spaces and illegal dumping. 

[Improves waste collection, segregation and handling policy ](https://github.com/kephothoX/Improved-Waste-Collection-Segregation-and-Handling-policy/tree/main) incentivises both foemal and informal waste pickers who  play a significant role in collecting and recycling valuable materials from waste streams. 

IWCSH quantifies waste interms of recycling, reusing, composting, chemical depolymerization, incineration and controlled landfills.



## Why the policy is necessary:
Garbage is a problem in developing countries due to inefficient waste handling and management practices, many landfills are stretched beyond their capacity posing danger not only to the environmnet, but communities within.
IWCSH approach attempts to salvage the situation by incorporating waste segregation and proper handling i.e composting, controlled incineration, chemical deppolymerization e.t.c

Any waste that is either recycled, reused or composted goes along way in reducing the amount of waste that ends up on landfills which are responsible for Methane gas emmisions.

## Roles:

- Project Owner:  Creates a project and fills out project monitoring reports on waste segregation and handling.
- Project Verifier:  Verifies project and reports.

## Schemas:
- Project registry schema.
- Waste segregation schema.
- Waste handling schema.

## Tokens:
-  IWCSH Token:   Issued to waste collection, segregation and  handling projects that use methods that promote climate mitigation measures in their operations, such as proper waste handling methods e.t.c
-  Waste Segregation Token: Issued to projects that demonstrate proven waste segregation in their reporting upon verification
-  Waste Handling Token (WHT): Issued to waste handling projects that promote methane and CO2 gas reduction in their operations
