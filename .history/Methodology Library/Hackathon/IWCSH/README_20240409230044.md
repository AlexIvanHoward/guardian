## Introduction:
In most developing countries, waste handling is a menace and most if not all ends up in a landfills, which in turn poses a greater risk to sorrounding communities and is responsible for  production of methane gas.
With proper waste segregation and handling, lots of waste that could otherwise end up in a landfill, could be reused, recycled or composted thereby overstretching landfills in developing countries.
In many developing countries  urban areas waste collection services are inadequate or non-existent, Lack of proper infrastructure, equipment, and funding for waste collection services leads to the accumulation of waste in public spaces and illegal dumping. 

[IWCSH policy ](https://github.com/kephothoX/guardian/tree/main) incentivises both formal and informal waste collectors who  play a significant role in waste collection and recycling of valuable materials from waste. 


## Need of IWCSH

Waste management is a challenge to many nations around the worth and its effect on climate change.
- Landfills alone are responsible for approx 14% of all global methane emissions.
- Mismanaged or over stretched landfills posses greater risk to nearby communities.
- Recycling and reusing waste products promotes circular economy keeping resources safe and long, also reducing impact waste has on our environment.
- Composting reduces landfill methane gas emissions.
-Minted tokens provides finance and incentives to project proponents.


## Policy Description:
IWCSH policy  emphasizes on waste segregation, recycling, composting, and responsible disposal methods, in turn significantly reducing  environmental impact  from poorly handled waste and contributing  towards mitigating climate change.


## Roles:

- Project Owner:  Creates a project and fills out project monitoring reports on waste segregation and handling.
- Project Verifier:  Verifies project and reports.

## Schemas:
- Project registry schema. Records data about a project i.e name, description. location, address, contact details,  e.t.c
- Waste segregation schema:  Waste segregation data (plastics, wet waste, harzadous waste e.t.t)
- Waste handling schema. Waste handling data (landfill, compostiong, recycling, reusing, e.t.c)

## Tokens:
-  IWCSH Token:   Issued to waste collection, segregation and  handling projects that use methods that promote climate mitigation measures in their operations, such as proper waste handling methods e.t.c
-  Waste Segregation Token: Issued to projects that demonstrate proven waste segregation in their reporting upon verification
-  Waste Handling Token (WHT): Issued to waste handling projects that promote methane and CO2 gas reduction in their operations

## Policy Baseline

Any waste that can be recycled, reused or composted goes along way towards reduction of landfill gasses and reduces amount of waste deposited on landfills.
